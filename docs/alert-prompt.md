There are few predefined functions present in browser to help us interact with user and also to help us with debugging. These functions can be executed with `()` after the function name in browser using developer tool `console`

### `alert`

It accepts a message in string data type as argument and opens a dialog box in the browser with `ok` button.

The job of the alert function is to display a dialog box with any message you pass in the browser.

```js
alert('Hello World!');
```

### `prompt`

It accepts a string data type as argument and displays it with an input box where user can enter value in the browser. `prompt` returns the data entered by user in the string data type.

```js
prompt('What is your age?'); // "21"
```

### `confirm`

It accepts a string data type as argument and shows a modal window in the browser with two buttons i.e `ok` and `cancel` . It returns `true` if user clicks `ok` or `false` if user click `cancel`

```js
